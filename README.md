## Description
A solution for mounting 9mm and 6mm gt2 belts to mgn12 carriage with M2-SHCS or 2mm pin. Designed to handle high belt tensions.
Versions for both inverted and normal belts.

## Features
- Belt Pin.
- Does not clamp the belt against the carriage.
- For monolith (inverted belts) it will not change the belt path (keeps the belt path perfectly straight).
- For normal belt direction there will be a ~0.8mm y offset.
- Keeps within the confines of the carriage (unless using the external clamps).
- builds 6mm out in y
- Tested with 15kg static load per belt


## Print Instructions
Print it upright, the strength comes from the layer direction. printing it in the incorrect orientation will result in a weaker part.
Use support (make sure your supports are tuned to the point where you're able to remove them carefully without breaking the part).
40%+ infill
4 perimitters
4 top and bottom layers
0.2mm layer height
0.4mm nozzle or smaller
